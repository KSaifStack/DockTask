##  Why DockTask?

I built DockTask to solve my own problem of managing multiple classwork deadlines while learning JavaFX development. What started as a simple to-do list evolved into a full-featured task management system as I explored UI/UX design, data persistence strategies, and memory optimization techniques. 

The core challenge? Basic calendar apps treat "3 PM" and "3:00:47 PM" the same, but when you have multiple assignments due at midnight, lab reports due minutes apart, and group project submissions with precise timing requirements, **seconds matter**.

This project pushed me to think beyond basic functionality and focus on creating a polished, user-friendly experience. **Now it's the tool I use daily to keep my academic life neat and organized.**

##  Architecture

DockTask implements **Model-View-Controller (MVC)** architecture for maintainable, testable code:

### Model Layer
- **UserData.java** — Centralized data access handling all CRUD operations
- **Data/** directory — File-based storage for user databases and settings (Settings.txt)
- Responsibilities: Data validation, serialization with `<SEP>` separators, persistence operations

### View Layer
- **TaskUi.java** — Main dashboard with task list and real-time countdown timers
- **CalendarUi.java** — Monthly calendar with task indicators and synchronization 
- **CreateTaskUi / UpdateTaskUi** — Task creation and editing interfaces with auto-save
- **Settings.java** — Application configuration panel with export/import, data management
- Responsibilities: UI rendering, user input collection, visual feedback, theme adaptation

### Controller Layer
- Event handlers connecting user actions to data operations
- **ThemeManager** — Coordinating theme state and color adaptation across components
- **Notification System** — Managing system tray alerts based on task deadlines
- **Timeline Controllers** — Orchestrating concurrent countdown updates
- **Navigation Guards** — Preventing accidental data loss during transitions
- Responsibilities: Business logic, state management, component coordination

**Benefits of this approach:**
- Data layer modifications (e.g., migrating to database) require zero UI changes
- UI redesigns proceed independently of data operations
- Individual components can be unit tested in isolation
- New features integrate cleanly without cascading modifications

## What I Learned

Building DockTask taught me valuable software engineering lessons:

### Memory Optimization (63% Reduction)
In version 0.1, countdown timers for completed or removed tasks continued running in the background, accumulating on the memory stack. This caused memory usage to grow from ~500MB to over 1000MB during extended sessions.

**Solution implemented:**
- Pause all Timeline threads when the application is minimized or closed
- Clear expired task entries from the active monitoring list after removal
- Implement proper cleanup of countdown timers for non-visible tasks

**Result:** Reduced idle memory footprint from 500MB to 60MB (85% improvement from peak) with sustained performance during long-running sessions. The application now becomes more efficient over time as resources are garbage collected.

### Other Key Learnings

- **Concurrent State Management:** Designed timeline system tracking multiple countdown timers simultaneously without data races or UI freezes

- **Data Persistence:** Built custom file-based serialization with `<SEP>` separators enabling support for embedded links and preventing parsing errors. Added validation to prevent corruption, auto-save with change detection, and safe import/export functionality

- **UI/UX Design:** Created theme-aware component system with instant propagation across 5+ view classes, responsive layouts, and intuitive information hierarchy with color-coded visual distinctions

- **Event-Driven Architecture:** Mastered JavaFX event system, listeners, and callback patterns for responsive interactions. Implemented navigation guards to prevent accidental data loss

- **Software Distribution:** Built self-contained Windows installer with bundled Java runtime for zero-dependency deployment
